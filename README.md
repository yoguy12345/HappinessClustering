# HappinessClustering
Clusters countries based on 6 features using KMeans, KMedoids, OPTICS, and Dbscan. 
Data from the annual World Health Report from 2015-2022 were used to see if happier countries cluster together.
Clusters are ranked based on a customized happiness score obtained through Principal component analysis(PCA) analysis to generate a weighted formula.
Streamlit framework and python are used to generate a website that shows clustering of the countries through years, recommends how to move to a "happier"
cluster, and shows the change in happiness per country over years.
